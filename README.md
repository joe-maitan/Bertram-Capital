Software Engineering Internship Bertram Capital Coding Problem

# The Problem
Bob, Jeremy, and the other 5 coworkers in the Bertram Labs office love coffee. Everyday,
right after lunch, they walk down the street to their favorite coffee shop to grab a cup to go. Bob
always gets a cappuccino, Jeremy likes his coffee black, and the others have their favorite
coffee beverage too. To ease the checkout process, only one coworker pays for all the coffees
each day. As you can imagine, they have a problem every day: who's turn is it to pay for coffee?

Write a software program to help coworkers decide who should pay for coffee. Consider that
not all drinks cost the same, so to be fair please take this into account when crafting your
solution.

# The Solution
Wrote a small program that initializes a small menu of items from a coffee shop and a small team of Bertram employees that go to get their coffee at said shop. This app then prompts the user two choices, randomly pick one of the coworkers to pay the bill or exit.

# How to run the program
The program can be run with the play button if you have installed Java extensions in VSCode or are using a Java specific IDE. 

Or can be compiled with the following command:

javac *.java

And to execute the program you would type:

java CoffeePaymentDecider

(I was using Windows PowerShell when testing with the manual compliation and execution approach.)
