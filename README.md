Software Engineering Internship Bertram Capital Coding Problem

# The Problem
Bob, Jeremy, and the other 5 coworkers in the Bertram Labs office love coffee. Everyday,
right after lunch, they walk down the street to their favorite coffee shop to grab a cup to go. Bob
always gets a cappuccino, Jeremy likes his coffee black, and the others have their favorite
coffee beverage too. To ease the checkout process, only one coworker pays for all the coffees
each day. As you can imagine, they have a problem every day: who's turn is it to pay for coffee?

Write a software program to help coworkers decide who should pay for coffee. Consider that
not all drinks cost the same, so to be fair please take this into account when crafting your
solution.
